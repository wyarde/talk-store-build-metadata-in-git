## What is build metadata

:::: {.element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"}

Build metadata is fancy for build ID.

::::

:::: {.element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"}

It identies a build and the artifacts it generates.

::::

::: notes

Artifacts could be:

- Container
- Package

- How to use build metadata to create a component-based CI/CD pipeline
- Components are built independent, each with their own artifact
- Only rebuild what has changed

## Disclaimers

### This talk

> - Uses fancy words
> - is opinionated
> - includes a live demo

::: notes

- Uses fancy words to make up for my lack of confidence
- State my opinion as facts. I believe it will trigger more reaction/thinking

:::

### You need a basic understanding of

- Git
- Containers
- Build pipelines
- (my) Humour

### ... in life!

## Versioning

<style>
.container{ display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column; }
.col{ font-size: 80%; }
</style>

::: {.container}
:::: {.col .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"}
$major-minor-patch$

- Describes public API
- Incremented manually
- Relatively static
::::

:::: {.col .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"}
$build-metadata$

- Links artifacts to commits
- Determined by the system
- Changes all the time
::::
:::

:::: {.element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"}

<sub><sup>Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 - https://semver.org</sup></sub>

::: notes

Versioning of Artifacts:

Major.minor.patch:

- External
- Stored in

  - versionInfo.json (old school)
  - Git tag

Build metadata:

- Internal
- Where and how to store?

:::

## Why link artifacts to commits?

\
commit $arrow-both$ artifacts

::: notes

Two reasons; we're going to look at arrows in both directions

:::

### For traceability

> - commit $arrow-left$ artifacts
> - ðŸ’¤ Boring ðŸ’¤

::: notes
Traceability means you can always find the version of code for any artifact/release/installer/installation. In open source, this concept is not that important anymore since distribution of build output is just for convenience
:::

### Keep track of all moving parts

> - commit $arrow-right$ artifacts
> - Only build what changed
> - ðŸŽˆ Fun! ðŸŽˆ

::: notes

Historically, not all that exciting. Every change requires a build anyway.
It's fun, especially with multiple parts as will see

:::

## Multiple moving parts

:::: {.element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"}
New feature, build 46
::::

:::: {.element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"}
![](images/pipeline.png)
::::

::: notes

Determine changes:

- Identifies what has changed

Build:

- Each component has an independent build, which can run in parallel
- Also run tests for each component
- Output is a docker container

Release:

- Collect all containers
- Release them

### Git history {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

![](images/git_history_1.png)

### Git history {data-transition="fade"}

![](images/git_history_2.png)

### Git history {data-transition="fade"}

![](images/git_history_3.png)

## Let's do IT!

1. Where to store it
2. How to manipulate it

### 1. Where?

> - In Git
> - ...but not in commits
> - Git tags?
> - Git notes!

![](images/git_history.png){width=60%}

::: notes

- Using versionInfo.json here is a very silly idea
- Since one end of the link is a git commit, storing in git makes a lot of sense
- A commit would be horrible; it pollutes the history and doesn't even work
- Tags have 2 drawbacks: Explosion of tags and doesn't support concurrent use
- Git notes are perfect!

:::

### Git notes

<sub><sup>_Supplement a commit message without changing the commit itself_</sup></sub>

- <span style="color:Moccasin">`git notes add|remove|show|list`</span>
- Stored as commits in refs/notes/

### 2. How?

Gino Keva - A simple Git Notes Key Value store
<$url-gino-keva$>

>- Store key/values in a note
>- List key/values for a commit

::: notes

- Implemented using event sourcing pattern
- Create materialized view with all events
