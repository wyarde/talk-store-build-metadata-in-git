## Disclaimers

### This talk

- is opinionated
- has a hidden agenda (wait for it)

### You need a basic understanding of

- Git
- Build pipelines
- (my) Humour

## What is build metadata

Build metadata is fancy for build ID.\
It identies a build and the artifacts it generates.
\
\
Artifacts could be:

- containers
- packages

## Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</span>-<span style="color:DodgerBlue">BUILD_METADATA</span>\
<sub><sup>https://semver.org</sup></sub>

### <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</span>

- Describes public API
- Incremented manually
- Relatively static

::: notes

- External
- Stored in
  - versionInfo.json (old school)
  - Git tag

:::

### <span style="color:DodgerBlue">BUILD_METADATA</span>

- Links artifacts to commits
- Determined by build system
- Changes all the time

::: notes

- Internal

:::

## Why link artifacts to commits?

### For traceability

- Build artifact âž¡ Commit SHA
- ðŸ’¤ Boring ðŸ’¤

::: notes
Traceability means you can always find the version of code for any artifact/release/installer/installation. In open source, this concept is not that important anymore since distribution of build output is just for convenience
:::

### Keep track of all moving parts

- Commit SHA âž¡ Build artifacts
- ðŸŽˆ Fun! ðŸŽˆ

::: notes
It's fun, especially with multiple parts as will see

## A system with multiple parts
